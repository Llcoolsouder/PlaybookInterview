# Playbook VR Test

## Build
1. Install [Unity 2020.3.42f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/lts-releases)
2. Clone this repo
3. Open project root directory in Unity
4. `File` -> `Build & Run` to---you guessed it---build and run! If all goes well you should be met with a cube with some handles for 3D interaction.
5. Drag the cones to translate the object. Drag spheres to scale the object on that axis. Drag the rings to rotate the object.
6. Use your OS's fullscreen/windowed toggle hotkey (`Alt`+`Enter` for Windows) to set the app to windowed mode, so that you can exit when you're ready.

_Note: This has only been tested on Windows. I make no promises about the functionality on any other platform._
