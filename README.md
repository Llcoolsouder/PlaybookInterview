# Playbook VR Test

## Build
1. Install [Unity 2020.3.42f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/lts-releases)
2. Clone this repo
3. Open project root directory in Unity
4. `File` -> `Build & Run` to---you guessed it---build and run! If all goes well you should be met with a cube with some handles for 3D interaction.
5. Use your OS's fullscreen/windowed toggle hotkey (`Alt`+`Enter` for Windows) to set the app to windowed mode, so that you can exit when you're ready.

_Note: This has only been tested on Windows. I make no promises about the functionality on any other platform._
